My simple portfolio site that uses GitHub Pages.

I've been thinking about creating a personal page for some time. After experimenting with Jekyll and several blogging platforms, I decided that something simple would be better for a central hub. Like with any projects I put out, this will also be a living document I'll tweak frequently.

I like small sites with little bits of flair here and there. I took some inspiration from the following if you also want to check them out:
